## What is Floorcraft?

Floorcraft is an open-source voxel engine inspired by games like Minecraft — but built different.

This isn’t about survival grind loops.  
This isn’t about combat balancing spreadsheets.

This is about building.

Massive structures. Clean architecture. Weird experiments. Overengineered megabases. Tiny minimalist builds. If it fits
on a grid, it belongs here.

## Why Floorcraft Exists

Because building shouldn’t feel like a side feature.

Floorcraft is designed to:

- Stay out of your way
- Be moddable without fighting the engine
- Let you control everything

You want to tweak textures? Easy.
You want to rewrite behavior? Go ahead.
You want to fork the engine and make something unrecognizable? Please do.

## Modding

Most modding happens inside the `assets/` directory.

The engine downloads it for you automatically.
Press **`X` in-game** and it opens instantly.

From there you can:

- Redefine blocks
- Change textures
- Break things

And since Floorcraft is fully open-source, modding doesn’t stop at assets. If you want to dive into the engine itself,
nothing’s stopping you.

If you're going to mod the engine itself, there are a few steps to help you! You can find
those [here](README-MODDING.md). Note this type of modding is extremely technical and requires knowledge of real
programming in most cases.
